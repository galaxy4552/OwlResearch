# OwlResearch Ethics Addendum

This document defines additional ethical guidelines that apply to all
source code, datasets, and representational frameworks in the OwlResearch
project.

These guidelines complement — but do not replace — the Apache 2.0 and
CC BY 4.0 licenses.

---

## 1. Privacy & Non-Reconstruction Principle

Any vectorized user-derived representation (e.g., embeddings,
persona vectors, tone vectors, style vectors) must **not** be used to:

- reconstruct the original user text,
- infer personal identity,
- perform de-anonymization or profiling,
- reverse-engineer sensitive linguistic traits.

These representations are provided strictly for research on
algorithms, semantics, and systems — **not** for user modeling.

---

## 2. No Harmful Use

The OwlResearch project may not be used to develop systems intended for:

- behavioral manipulation,
- psychological exploitation,
- surveillance or coercive profiling,
- unauthorized biometric inference,
- military targeting,
- social scoring systems.

---

## 3. Transparency in Derivative Work

If you build upon, remix, or extend components of OwlResearch:

- Clearly disclose your modifications.
- Specify the purpose of your changes.
- Declare any newly added datasets.
- Include safety notes if your work alters semantics or embeddings.

---

## 4. Scientific Integrity

All research derived from this project should:

- avoid overstated claims,
- document experimental conditions,
- respect reproducibility standards,
- acknowledge limitations of semantic or vector-based methods.

---

## 5. Non-Model Guarantee

This project **does not include** a complete language model.
Contributors may not represent OwlResearch as an LLM or AGI system.

It is a research toolkit — not a model.
