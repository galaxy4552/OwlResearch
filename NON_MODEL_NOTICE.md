# Non-Model Notice

OwlResearch is **not a language model**.

This repository contains:

- semantic extraction utilities,
- vector transformation frameworks,
- intent-field representations,
- structural components for research,
- experimental algorithms.

It does **not** include:

- a generative model,
- a decoding engine,
- training checkpoints,
- model weights,
- systems that can independently produce text.

Any downstream system that uses OwlResearch components must provide
its own model and clearly distinguish between "model" and "framework".

OwlResearch is an infrastructure layer — not an autonomous generator.
