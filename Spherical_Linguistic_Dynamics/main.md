A Field-Based Framework for Vectorized Language Computation

Micro Whitepaper v0.1 — 王楷霖 / OwlResearch Series

Abstract

We outline a minimal field-based formulation of linguistic meaning.
Tokens, vectors, and meta-language processes are unified as trajectories on a curved semantic manifold.
This micro whitepaper establishes the conceptual foundation for downstream systems such as NCO, VecOwl, and PipOwl.

1. Conceptual Overview

Human language is modeled not as discrete symbolic units,
but as motion within a continuous semantic field.

This framework introduces：

Token → Vector → Field Pipeline
Each expression is projected into a vector space and stabilized by field curvature.

Meta-Linguistic Recursion
Semantic states update through iterative

S(x)=D(E(x)),F(v)=Φ(v).

Spherical Dynamics
The semantic field is represented as a sphere-like manifold where
meaning evolves smoothly along geodesic-like flows.

3. Key Contributions（v0.1）

A unified formulation linking discrete tokens to continuous semantic geometry

Field-stabilized meaning updates compatible with real-time engines

A minimal recursive decoding rule applicable to IME, LLM, and vector tools

Establishes the theoretical backbone of OwlGalaxy (NCO, VecOwl, PipOwl)

4. Applications
NCO – Real-Time Semantic Input Engine

Uses field curvature + dynamic context to re-rank and rewrite candidates.

VecOwl – Minimal LLM Decoder

Decodes directly from field-updated vectors rather than token prediction.

PipOwl – Semantic Embedding Shell

Supplies raw vectors + persona embeddings + cross-language bridges.

LPV / Dark / Persona Systems

Field dynamics naturally supports multi-persona vector mixing.

5. Position in OwlResearch Series

This document is the umbrella brief for the following technical branches：

VecOwl/vecowl_brief.md

PipOwl/pipowl_brief.md

Each branch will have its own micro-whitepaper expanding the details.
